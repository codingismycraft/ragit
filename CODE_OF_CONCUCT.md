# Contributor Code of Conduct

As contributors and maintainers of the "ragit" project, we pledge to respect
everyone who contributes by posting issues, updating documentation, submitting
pull requests, and providing feedback in reviews.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project email
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an
appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project team at [dev.adaptaware@gmail.com]. All complaints will be
reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed
necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated
to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.

Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.
