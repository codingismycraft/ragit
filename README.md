# RAGit: A Framework for Generalized RAG Solutions

RAGit is an open-source framework designed to simplify the creation and
management of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) solutions. By abstracting
away the complexities of data management, model selection, and infrastructure,
RAGit empowers developers to focus on application logic and customization. 

# Core Principles

The core principles behind RAGit can be summarized as follows:

### Generality

RAGit can by applied to any set of data than can provided in a wide range of
data types providing a flexible foundation for building custom RAG applications.

### Simplicity

RAGit prioritizes ease of use by abstracting the underlying complexities of data
management. Users can concentrate on refining document selection and optimizing
results without being encumbered by low-level implementation details.

### Configurability

RAGit offers extensive customization options, enabling users to experiment with
various hyperparameters. From chunk splitting strategies to vector distance
algorithms and prompt engineering, users have granular control over the RAG
pipeline.

### Comprehensiveness

Beyond model training and inference, RAGit provides tools for data ingestion,
processing, and management.

### Vendor Neutrality

RAGit is designed to be agnostic to specific underlying technologies, enabling
easy switching between different components and services.

By adhering to these principles, RAGit aims to accelerate the development of
effective and robust RAG solutions.
